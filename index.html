      <p>Family Check-In is a 3-step program designed to help families with children ages 2-7 who have questions and concerns about their child's behavior or their parenting.</p>
      <p>Clinicians and family members collaborate to assess how the family is doing, identify family strengths, and generate individualized feedback. The team will then collaborate with the family in developing an action plan to make the changes for their well-being. Clinicians will help connect the family to opportunities and services that fit their family's needs.</p>
